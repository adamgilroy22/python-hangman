## __Code Validation__
I validated both my run.py and graphics.py files using [Code Institute's Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and was met with no errors in both files.

## __Cross-browser Testing__
After deploying the program through Heroku, I have tested it on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The program has loaded perfectly and had no issues running as expected across all browsers.
